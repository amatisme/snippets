# snippets
Collection of code snippets with commentary on why I think they are interesting. I have commented in my understanding of the code plus the things I don't quite understand. I will add new ones as I move through getting a better understanding of various languages, libraries and platforms. I would like to use this to showcase how much I love code to any one willing to read. Projects are good, but often clients do not have the time or resources to beta test your code. Most of my work from the last 15 years is no longer available to me, in absentia, I am hoping these snippets let you into my head so you can poke around and get to know me.

This month I am reading through the (YDKJS) book series by Kyle Simpson. I have been using JS for almost 20 years now and I am always amazed there is more to learn. I have always wanted a deeper knowledge and now I have the time to do so. I am also not limited by legacy applications requiring ES5 support without transpiling. ES6 is quite an upgrade, so
progress will likely be slower than I want it to be, but the end game is truly understanding JS and all it's weirdness so it is definetly worth it! :)
